# Custom User Interfaces
Dynamically generated user interfaces are often enough to get started with building your solution.
However, you sometimes need to be able to provide custom screens for end users.

For example:

1. A set of dashboard weblets that users can add to their dashboards
2. Simplified screens to configure and create requests and objects

Lucy includes a user interface builder to design screens that can be wired up to your models in the backend.

## Linking your model to a user interface
The easiest way to get started is to go to the **UI** tab of the [Model Designer](model-designer) and click the *Create a user interface for this model* button. That will generate a new UI Bundle and link it to the current model. You can then select views from that bundle to override the dynamically generated interfaces. See [Configuring Dynamic User Interfaces](dynamicuis.md#configdynuis) for more information.

See [Building User Interfaces](uis.md#uis) for more information on building custom user interfaces.
